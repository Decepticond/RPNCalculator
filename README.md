# RPNCalculator
*Calculator project for school that was definitely not a flop.*

There aren't mmany edgy graphing calculators out there, and thus I have decided to make one.


**Here's why:**
1- Your math homework experience will be much more stylized.
2- Your ability to get a quick, and accurate response from a digital calculator without wifi is here.


**Built With:**

1- tkinter
2- TTButton
3- operators 


**Getting Started:**

1- Download the files main.py, gui.py, themath.py, and rpn.py and put them all in one folder, preferrably named "Calculator".
2- Once you have done such, open the main.py file which will open the calculator.


**Prerequisites:**

1- You will need to ensure you have Python3.11.3 installed, in order to do so please visit this site and follow the instructions for your OS: https://www.python.org/downloads

2- You will also want to install pip3, in order to do such run sudo apt install python3-pip in your terminal.

3- Once you have installed pip3, run pip3 --install tkinter || pip3 -- install TTButton || pip3 --install operators


**Usage:**

-- In order to succesfully use this calculator, you will need to have a basic understanding of how a generic calculator functions.
-- You can click on the entry field and input whichever equation you require, or use the button, therre is a CLR button that clears the entire output and input, as well as the graph that doesn't exactly work. 
-- There is a del button which clears the last inputted character, as well as a graph button which if pressed aftere you input an equation/number will display
a graph.
